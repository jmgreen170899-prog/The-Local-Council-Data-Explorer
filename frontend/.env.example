# API Base URL for the backend service
# 
# For Docker/production deployment: Leave EMPTY or unset.
#   The frontend makes relative requests to /api/... which nginx proxies to the backend.
#   DO NOT use Docker-internal hostnames like "http://council-explorer-api:8000" 
#   as browsers cannot resolve them (only Docker containers can).
#
# For local development with Vite dev server: Leave EMPTY or unset.
#   Vite's proxy (configured in vite.config.ts) forwards /api requests to localhost:8000.
#
# For local development WITHOUT Vite proxy: http://localhost:8000
